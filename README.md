This is the GitHub exercise from the Version Control Module
To get here, I found a MoT Repository on their GitHub. FORKED it onto my profile to have a local branch on my own GitHub profile.
I then went onto my own GitHub Desktop and created a 'CLONE' to branch off the main local Version
Then I found the downloaded, aka Cloned, version on my machine and made these changes here on the README. File
